This directory contains a docker container description, example programs in
COOL, and supporting code. Install docker, make sure dockerd is up and running,
and use run.sh to start the container. You now have a shell into the container.
Print the README.md inside there for more instructions.

Once you leave the shell, stop the container and remove the image via stop.sh.
